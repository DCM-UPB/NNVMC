# LEGEND OF THE EXAMPLES

Make sure the examples are compiled, by running `make examples` in the project root folder.
Execute an example by switching into one of the example folders and running `./exe`.
Some examples might also contain a `plot.py` script to show a plot.
Run it after the exe by `python plot.py` (requires matplotlib).


## Example 1

`ex1/`: integration using a FeedForwardNeuralNetwork, making the integrals with and without MC


## Example 2

`ex2/`: another NN-MC integration example with beta derivatives calculation


## Example 3
