This neural network library was originally created in 2017-2018 by Francesco Calcavecchia,
while working in a postdoctoral position for the Dynamic of Condensed Matter group,
led by Prof. Dr. Thomas D. KÃ¼hne at Paderborn University (Germany).
In early 2018, Jan Kessler (from the same research group) began contributing and became
the main developer and administrator in mid 2018.

Here we maintain a list of people who significantly contributed to the project, by any means:

    Jan Kessler (Ithanil)
    Francesco Calcavecchia (francesco086)
