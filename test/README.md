# LEGEND OF THE UNIT TESTS

Use `./run.sh` inside the test directory to run the check program and unit tests
with valgrind or use `make test` inside the build directory, to run unit tests without valgrind.


## Unit Test 1

`ut1/`: check that the FFNNWaveFunction behaves correctly making a comparison between a very simple neural network and a plain written wf that reproduces the neural network.
